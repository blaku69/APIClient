make jsons easier with this api application

in headers to make a header just type your key then : then value like key:value then to make a new header just add a space and do the same

the json simplifier replaces strings so you can just type what you want without putting " everytime

Example:

username=blaku passwords[blakutest blaku=test blaku=api]

turns into

{"username":"blaku","passwords":["blakutest","blaku":"test","blaku":"api"]}
