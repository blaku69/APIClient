make jsons easier with this api application

for headers and params put the key at the first text box and the second for the value

the json simplifier replaces strings so you can just type what you want without putting " everytime

Example:

username=blaku passwords[blakutest blaku=test blaku=api] function(hi,hi=bye)

turns into

{"username":"blaku","passwords":["blakutest","blaku":"test","blaku":"api"] "function":{"hi","hi":"bye"}


()={} []=[]  = = : space=,
